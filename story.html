              When mom was teaching High School back in the 50s, she was a very tough gymnastics teacher. Since she was a dance minor she was athletically inclined, in great shape and very disciplined. She expected her students to respond accordingly. One day a group of cheerleaders came up to mom and said they could not work out that day because it would mess up their hair and makeup before they cheered that evening.
